        <h1>Academic research has a huge money problem</h1>

        <p>As we know it, every project taken on by an artist, student, scientist etc starts with a cost. It is safe to say that to do most any kind of research, scientists need money: to run studies, to subsidize lab equipment, to pay their assistants and even their own salaries.</p>
        <p>The grip isnt just with the quantity,which, in many fields, is shrinking. It's the way money is handed out that puts presssure on labs to publish a lot of papers, breeds conflict of interest and encourages scientists to overhype their work. Around two-thirds of basic research is <a href="The%20Changing%20Nature%20of%20U.S.%20Basic%20Research_%20Trends%20in%20Funding%20Sources%20_%20SSTI.html">privately funded</a>. The priorities of the people handing out the funding often effect what research gets done. For example, Corporations and trade groups such as big sugar and pharmacutical drug companies, tend to fund research that will make them money: <a href="Science's%20Worst%20Enemy_%20Corporate%20Funding%20_%20DiscoverMagazine.com.html">Jennifer Washburn Discover, 11 Oct 2007.</a> <br><br> In the United states academic researchers in the sciences generally cannot rely on university funding alone to pay their saleries, assistants, and lab costs. Instead they have to seek out grants. Grants also usually expire after three or so years, which pushes scientists away from long-term projects. Outside grants are also increasingly short supply. In the US, the largest source of the funding is the federal government, and that pool of money hs been plateauing for years, while young scientists enter the workforce at a faster rate than old scientists retire.</p><p>Take the National Institutes of Health, a major funding source. Its budget rose at a fast clip through the 1990s, stalled in the 2000s, and then dipped with sequestration budget cuts in 2013. All the while, rising costs for conducting science meant that each NIH dollar purchased less and less. Last year, Congress approved the biggest NIH <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/national-institutes-of-health-congress-budget/423837">spending hike in a decade.</a> But it won’t erase the shortfall.</p>
        <p>The consequences are striking: In 2000, more than 30 percent of NIH grant applications got approved. Today, it’s closer to 17 percent. "It's because of what's happened in the last 12 years that young scientists in particular are feeling such a squeeze," NIH Director Francis Collins <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-cancer-moonshot-20160502-snap-htmlstory.html">said</a> at the Milken Global Conference in May.</p>
        <h2>Fixes for science's funding woes</h2>
        <p>Right now there are arguably too many researchers chasing too few grants. Or, as a 2014 <a href="http://rescuingbiomedicalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PNAS-2014-Alberts-5773-7.pdf">piece</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences put it: "The current system is in perpetual disequilibrium, because it will inevitably generate an ever-increasing supply of scientists vying for a finite set of research resources and employment opportunities."</p>
        <p>"As it stands, too much of the research funding is going to too few of the researchers," writes Gordon Pennycook, a PhD candidate in cognitive psychology at the University of Waterloo. "This creates a culture that rewards fast, sexy (and probably wrong) results."</p>
        <p>One straightforward way to ameliorate these problems would be for governments to simply increase the amount of money available for science. (Or, more controversially, decrease the number of PhDs, but we’ll get to that later.) If Congress boosted funding for the NIH and National Science Foundation, that would take some of the competitive pressure off researchers.</p>
        <p>But that only goes so far. Funding will always be finite, and researchers will never get blank checks to fund the risky science projects of their dreams. So other reforms will also prove necessary.</p><img src="ScienceIcon.gif" height="350" width="300" alt="Icon" style="float: left; margin: 5px;">
        <p>One suggestion: Bring more stability and predictability into the funding process. "The NIH and NSF budgets are subject to changing congressional whims that make it impossible for agencies (and researchers) to make long term plans and commitments," M. Paul Murphy, a neurobiology professor at the University of Kentucky, writes. "The obvious solution is to simply make [scientific funding] a stable program, with an annual rate of increase tied in some manner to inflation."</p>
        <p>"Bitter competition leads to group leaders working desperately to get any money just to avoid closing their labs, submitting more proposals, overwhelming the grant system further. It's all kinds of vicious circles on top of each other."—Maximilian Press, graduate student in genome science, University of Washington
        Another idea would be to change how grants are awarded: Foundations and agencies could fund specific people and labs for a period of time rather than individual project proposals. (The Howard Hughes Medical Institute already does this.) A system like this would give scientists greater freedom to take risks with their work.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, researchers in the journal mBio recently <a href="http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/2/e00422-16.full.pdf">called for</a> a lottery-style system. Proposals would be measured on their merits, but then a computer would randomly choose which get funded.</p>
        <p>"Although we recognize that some scientists will cringe at the thought of allocating funds by lottery," the authors of the mBio piece write, "the available evidence suggests that the system is already in essence a lottery without the benefits of being random." Pure randomness would at least reduce some of the perverse incentives at play in jockeying for money.</p>
        <p>There are also some ideas out there to minimize conflicts of interest from industry funding. Recently, in PLOS Medicine, Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis suggested that pharmaceutical companies <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002049">ought to pool the money</a> they use to fund drug research, to be allocated to scientists who then have no exchange with industry during study design and execution. This way, scientists could still get funding for work crucial for drug approvals — but without the pressures that can skew results.</p>
        <p>These solutions are by no means complete, and they may not make sense for every scientific discipline. The daily incentives facing biomedical scientists to bring new drugs to market are different from the incentives facing geologists trying to map out new rock layers. But based on our survey, funding appears to be at the root of many of the problems facing scientists, and it’s one that deserves more careful discussion.</p>
